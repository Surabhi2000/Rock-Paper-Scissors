Thanks Frontend Mentor  for giving this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Rules

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.

#### Original

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
